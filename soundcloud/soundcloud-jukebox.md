# Jukebox Project w/ SoundCloud API: Individual - approx 20 hours

**Goal:** 

Successfully implement the SoundCloud API into a current project

**Assignment:** 

Remember that Jukebox Starter Kit? Well now itâ€™s time to make it awesome! Take your current jukebox and tweak it so that it can play songs hosted on SoundCloud. This is also the time to make changes to UI/UX of the application so that it looks and feels like a true jukebox.

**Before you Begin:**

  1. Create a SoundCloud [main account](https://soundcloud.com/) if you havent already
  2. Use the API Key provided to you by your instructor
  3. Read and understand the [streaming music example](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/guide#streaming) provided to you by their provided sdk
  4. Unfortunately, the SoundCloud 3.0 SDK playback feature uses flash when on Google Chrome and does not work by default. Try disabling the flash plugin through the `chrome://plugins/` menu (type it into the location bar).
  5. If you intend on the doing the challenge take a look at the playlist [documentation](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/reference#playlists)
  6. For further documentation check out their [API guide](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/guide)

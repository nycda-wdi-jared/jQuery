# [fit] jQuery:<br>A JavaScript Utility Library

Plus: Anonymous Functions & Callbacks

---

# Using external JavaScript libraries

- A library is simply a collection of functions and code that someone has written to make a set of tasks easier in a specific programming language

- By including the library in your code, you'll have access to its functions and methods

---

# Exercise - understanding libraries

- Create a new file, `my_library.js`

- Inside of this file, write a function that does something and returns feedback in an alert or console message

- Include `my_library.js` in an HTML file

- Call the function in an arbitrary `<script>` block after your library has been loaded with a `<script>` tag:

````html
<script>
  myFunction();
</script>
````
---

# Common library problems

- Load the page with the JavaScript console open (Command + Option + J) to see if any errors are raised when the page and library are loaded

- Sometimes libraries conflict with each other due to similar naming conventions of functions and methods

- You may have to remove a library or edit it to get it to work with another library

- To check to see if a library is loaded, try calling one of its functions or methods. For instance, to make sure jQuery is loaded, just try calling `jQuery` in the JavaScript console

---

# jQuery

- `jQuery` is a self described "write less, do more" library

- It can be marginally slower than using native JavaScript but exposes much JavaScript functionality in a very developer-friendly and cross-browser-friendly way

- The 2.x version does not support IE6, 7 or 8 if this is important to know for your project

---

# Including the jQuery library

- Inside of the <head> section of your HTML file, include a copy of the jQuery library:

````html
<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js">
</script>
````

- In the above case, our copy of the library is from the Google Content Delivery Network, meaning it should be loaded pretty quickly no matter where our user is located

- You could also just download the library and include it in your project directory, referencing it relatively

---

# The Document Object Model (DOM)

- The DOM is a standard for interacting with and representing objects in HTML, XHTML, and XML

- It has been around since the "browser wars" of the 90s

- Web browsers implement a standard version of it to normalize how HTML elements are interacted with

- jQuery makes it incredibly easy to select elements in the DOM, which include practically any HTML tag or element

---

# Selecting elements with jQuery

- jQuery can be used to select elements using a similar syntax to CSS

- Try this first line in the JavaScript console of a page that has jQuery included:

  ````js
  $("body")
  ````

- It should return an `Array` with selected elements:

  ````js
  >[><body>...</body>]
  ````

---

# Selecting elements with jQuery

The format for selecting elements is:

````js
$("<element name, class, id, or XPath>")
````

Here are some examples:

````js
$("p")
$(".main-nav")
$("ul li")
````

---

# Selecting elements: a closer look

- By calling `$`, we're just using a shorthand way of accessing the jQuery library's main `function`, that all others are descended from

- Try typing just a `$` in the JavaScript console and pressing enter to see the function itself

- The `("<element identifier")` after `$` is simply an argument being passed to the library's main function

---

# JavaScript Events: monitoring the DOM

- An incredibly key feature of JavaScript is being able to monitor for certain events being fired by specific DOM elements

- For instance, we could monitor for a `click` event on a `<button>` element to fire a specific snippet of code

---

# The `$(document).ready()` snippet

- This snippet ensures that your code doesn't run until your document fires a `ready` event

- The ready event fires when all of the page's DOM elements are loaded, even if multimedia elements aren't fully loaded

- By encapsulating all of our `jQuery` code to only run when the document is ready, the elements you're selecting will definitely be on the page when you access them

---

## Anonymous functions

- are another way to write functions that makes them a "first-class citizen" data type meaning they can be:

  - given as an argument to a function (yes, a function taking a function)

  - returned by a function or block of code

  - assigned to a variable

---

# Writing anonymous functions

````js
function(){
  alert("I am anonymous!");
}
````

- Anonymous functions can be stored in variables:

````js
var myAnonFunc = function(){ alert("Har!"); }
````

---

# Callbacks

- Anonymous functions are often used in **callback**s

- A **callback** is an anonymous function supplied to another function to be run when that function is done running

---

# Callback Example

````js
// Define an anonymous function called someOtherFunction
var someOtherFunction = function(){ alert('hello world'); }

// Declare a regular or anonymous function that takes another
// function as an argument, does something,
// then runs that other function
function someRunner(anyFunction){ console.log(2+2); anyFunction(); }

// Call the regular function, supplying the initial
// anonymous function as an argument
someRunner(someOtherFunction);
````
---

# Using `$(document).ready()`

To use $(document).ready() and ensure the page is ready for your jQuery, you'll need to pass it an anonymous function (a callback) to execute when the `document` is `ready`

````js
$(document).ready( 
  //Code that executes when the document is ready
  function(){
    alert('The document is ready, sah!');
  }
);
````


---

#[fit]The<br>Fun<br>Stuff

Try these out in your JavaScript console
(Command + Option + J)

If you're using jQuery in an actual file/script, don't forget the
`$(document).ready()` wrapper!

---

# Showing and hiding

To show or hide an element on the page with jQuery, select it and call the `show()` or `hide()` function on your selection

````js
$("body").hide();

$("body").show();
````

---

# Fading in, fading out

To show or hide an element on the page using a fading animation, select it and call the `fadeIn()` or `fadeOut()` function on your selection

````js
$("#section-one").fadeOut();

$("#section-one").fadeIn();
````

---

# Fade over time

You can give the `fadeOut()` and `fadeIn()` functions a time in milliseconds as an argument over which they should fade in and out

````js
$("#section-one").fadeOut(1000);
//Fade out over 1 second

$("#section-one").fadeIn(4000);
//Fade in over 4 seconds
````
---

# Hiding with sliding

Another way of hiding and showing items on the page is by using the `slideUp()` or `slideDown()` methods

````js
$("#section-one").slideUp(1000);
//Fade out over 1 second

$("#section-one").slideDown(4000);
//Fade in over 4 seconds
````

---

# Animating CSS

Use jQuery's `animate()` method to animate most CSS properties that are numeric

````js
$(".my-element").animate( {
  opacity: 0.25,
  width: "70%"
} , 2000 );
````
---

# The click event

- Remember that JavaScript events can be fired on any HTML element

- To monitor an HTML element for the click event and then fire a callback function with some code:

````js
$("ul li a").click(
  function(){
    alert('imclicked!');
  }
);
````

---

# Using a callback for a sequence

Here's an example of one animation triggering another when it's done, using an anonymous function as a callback:

````js
var animateMenu = function(){
  $(".menu").animate( {opacity: .5} )
}
$(".menu").show(animateMenu)
````
---

# Simplified syntax

The last example could also be written like this:

````js
$(".menu").show( function(){
  $(".menu").animate( {opacity: .5} )
})
````

---

# Exercise - using jQuery

- Create a basic HTML page with no styling that has at least 10 separate elements on it

- Use jQuery to create an animated "show"! Try changing an element's CSS, hiding, showing, fading, and sliding, and making the page run amok

- Once the "show" works, rig it up to only fire when the user clicks anywhere on the page

- If you finish this exercise, implement jQuery into some of the websites you built last week and try playing around with some other functions: http://api.jquery.com/

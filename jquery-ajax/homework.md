# AJAX/jQuery/Javascript

Goal:

* Demonstrate an understanding of javascript, jQuery, and Ajax calls.

Assignment:

* Make an API call using Ajax and append at least 5 items from each response to the screen.

Before you Begin:

* Look at all of the assignments that we have been working on in class.

Understand how to:

* Get a 'response' from the call
* Append items to a div that you created in jQuery
* Append that div or the jQuery created items to the html div

Your Ajax/jQuery assignment should:

* Use an input or some kind of search to query the api
* Append a completely new item per search, and not keep appending previous searches to the last search

Extra Challenge:

* If you're using the weather API, add a temperature gauge to show the weather
* Any API, Use an on click to go to the next item as part of that response
* Use buttons to narrow down specific queries/conditionals in a response

Grading Criteria:

* JS throws no errors
* Effort & Time
* Knowledge of javascript & jQuery shown

Complete = Meets ALL grading criteria points above.

Incomplete = Does not meet all or most of the grading criteria points above. Needs improvement or missing submission.

# Jukebox Starter Kit Workshop

Goal:

* Demonstrate an understanding of objects in JavaScript.

Assignment:

* This Starter Kit workshop is designed for you to create the foundation for your next project! You've had a bit of time to get familiar with object oriented JavaScript. Now letâ€™s build a Jukebox!

* You will build a music player that will end up playing any mp3 you can find online. Think about what functionality you might need for this to work. Encapsulate all of this functionality in a JavaScript object so that starting a song is as simple as calling Jukebox.play() You need an array of song objects and the ability to play, stop and pause a song. How would you switch songs? Can you shuffle songs? Focus on getting the JavaScript to work and keep the HTML/CSS minimal, make it work before you make it look good!

* Hint: The next project you will be able to continue styling this Jukebox and API integration.

Before you Begin:

* Read through this tutorial describing how to use html5 audio (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. and control playback using javascript.

Your JavaScript Jukebox should:

* Display at least one song on the page when the page loads
* Give the user the ability to play that song, without using the "built-in" play button. This could be through a different button, through clicking or mousing over an image on the page, or any other device of your choosing.
* Give the user the ability to stop that song without using the "built-in" stop button. Once again, this could be through a different button, through clicking or mousing over an image on the page, or any other device of your choosing.
* Give the user the ability to load at least one different song into the Jukebox besides the one that is loaded when the page initially renders
* The whole Jukebox should be backed by an object called Jukebox with methods to play, stop, and load songs.

Extra Challenge:

* Playlist of songs, allows the user to queue up the next song
* Feature to request a random song

Grading Criteria:

* JS throws no errors
* Pause, Play, and Stop functions work (and do not use built-in functionality)
* JukeBox is object-oriented
* Page has at least one song on load and can play a different song based on title
* Allow a user to load one of their own songs
